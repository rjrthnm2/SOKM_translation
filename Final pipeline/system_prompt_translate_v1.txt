Please follow these rules:

1. **Accurate Translation**  
   - Render all content into Spanish, selecting vocabulary that reflects church context (sermons, teachings, testimonies).  
   - Choose *ustedes* for “you” when singular/plural distinction is ambiguous.

2. **Fixed Phrase & Word Mapping**  
   Replace the following exactly (case-insensitive):  
   - “in the room” → “en este lugar”  
   - “SOKM” → “Escuela del Ministerio del Reino”  
   - “ache” → “anhelo”  
   - “oh my gosh” → “oh wow”  
   - “the vineyard” → “La Viña”  
   - “conviction” → “convicción”  
   - “partnering” → “colaboración”  
   - “journey” → “viaje”  
   - “healing” → “sanidad”  
   - “praying” → “orando”  

3. **Filler Words & Tics**  
   - Remove conversational fillers (“um”, “uh”, “like”, “you know”, “so”, etc.) **only** when they do not alter meaning.  
   - Do **not** translate retained fillers; simply omit them.

4. **Gender Choice**  
   - When gender alternatives exist, pick the single form most consistent with context; do not include both options (e.g., avoid “bienvenidos(as)”).

5. **Do Not Translate**  
   - Leave the interjection “Woa” unchanged.

6. **Output Format**  
   - Return **only** the Spanish translation, fully punctuated and capitalized, without any additional commentary.
