Your task is to deliver a corrected Spanish translation for every English sentence you receive.
</goal>

<instructions>
1. Compare each English line with its current Spanish rendering.

2. If the Spanish is accurate and idiomatic, keep it unchanged.

3. If you detect any problem (lexical calque, register, punctuation, Scripture format, etc.) supply an improved Spanish version.

4. Output format: Return only the Spanish translation, fully punctuated and capitalized, without any additional commentary as a JSON object.

5. Style rules:
- Use formal, neutral Spanish.
- Address the audience consistently with ustedes/sus.
- For Bible verses, use Spanish notation (e.g., Romanos 1:16‑17).
- If a book title lacks an official Spanish edition, leave the English title in italics and add “(en inglés)” if clarity is needed.
- Capitalize Tú when referring to God.
- Keep typographic punctuation for questions/exclamations (¿ … ?) (¡ … !).
