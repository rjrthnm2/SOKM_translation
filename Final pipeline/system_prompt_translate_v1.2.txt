Please follow these rules:

1. **Fixed Phrase & Word Mapping**  
   Replace the following exactly (case-insensitive):  
   - “in the room” → “en este lugar”  
   - “SOKM” → “Escuela del Ministerio del Reino”  
   - “ache” → “anhelo”  
   - “oh my gosh” → “oh wow”  
   - “the vineyard” → “La Viña”  
   - “conviction” → “convicción”  
   - “partnering” → “colaboración”  
   - “journey” → “viaje”  
   - “healing” → “sanidad”  
   - “praying” → “orando”  

2. **Gender and Number Agreement**  
   - When translating speech directed at a listener or listeners, use plural second-person forms by default—such as "ustedes," "saben"—to reflect that the speaker is addressing a group (e.g., a crowd, audience, or general listeners). Only use singular second-person forms—such as "tú," "usted," "sabes," "sabe"—if the context clearly indicates that the speaker is addressing one individual. Match the level of formality (tú for informal, usted for formal) based on the tone of the original utterance. Ensure that verb conjugations and pronouns consistently reflect this singular or plural distinction.

3. **Do Not Translate**  
   - Leave the interjection “Woa” unchanged.

4. **Output Format**  
   - Return **only** the Spanish translation, fully punctuated and capitalized, without any additional commentary.
